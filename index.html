  <h1>Milestones In Car Technology</h1>
  <h4>Adaptive Cruise Control</h4>
  <div class="daddy-shark">
    <p>
      Commuting is no fun. But advanced driver assist systems like adaptive cruise control can take a lot of the stress
      out of the experience. By using an array of sensors built into the car, adaptive cruise control can match the speed
      of the car in front of you, meaning you don't need to constantly hit the gas and brake in highway traffic.
      Some systems even allow the car to be brought to a complete halt and then resume automatically, making stop-and-go traffic
      considerably less frustrating. It might make you uneasy handing over some amount of control to the car, but we promise: use
      it once, and you'll never want to go back.

  <h4>Automatic Emergeny Braking</h4>

    <p>
      Automatic Emergency Braking or AEB uses a variety of sensors to determine if a forward collision
      crash is imminent and automatically applies the brakes to diminish the severity or avoid a crash entirely.
      The auto industry agreed to make AEB standard in cars by 2022, but many vehicles have it available today.
      The systems are extremely good, though you absolutely shouldn't rely on it to stop you -- it's meant as a last
      resort for when the driver isn't paying attention, and it's extremely alarming when the system does engage.
      While Apple CarPlay and smartphone apps are important, this one could save your life, so it's worth making this one
      a high priority on your shopping list

  <h4>360-Degree Camera</h4>

    <p>
        Insurance claims from low-speed crashes are some of the most common in the
      industry. Usually occurring during parking, a 360-degree camera system can
      make life a lot easier for folks who might not realize just how big that new SUV is.
      By combining cameras on every side of the car with some clever computing power,
      your car's display can show a virtual top-down view of your surroundings.
      It can show the sides of your garage, whether you're lined up in the parking spot at the
      grocery store, or provide invaluable assistance while parallel parking.
      The systems are getting cheaper and cheaper, and are available on even moderately
      priced cars these days. If you're in the market for a small hatchback, you might
      not need this one as much -- but a big SUV? You could find it invaluable.
