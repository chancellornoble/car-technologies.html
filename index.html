  <h4>Adaptive Cruise Control</h4>
  <div class="daddy-shark">
    <p>
      Commuting is no fun. But advanced driver assist systems like adaptive cruise control can take a lot of the stress
      out of the experience. By using an array of sensors built into the car, adaptive cruise control can match the speed
      of the car in front of you, meaning you don't need to constantly hit the gas and brake in highway traffic.
      Some systems even allow the car to be brought to a complete halt and then resume automatically, making stop-and-go traffic
      considerably less frustrating. It might make you uneasy handing over some amount of control to the car, but we promise: use
      it once, and you'll never want to go back.
