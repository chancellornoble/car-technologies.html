  <h4>Adaptive Cruise Control</h4>
  <div class="first-heading">
    <p>
      Going on long trips can be stressful, but now cars have technology that can
      make your experience less stressful. Systems like adaptive cruise control
      make traveling a lot easier. Adaptive cruise control is a system that is used
      on the highway in order to keep your vehicle a safe distance away from the
      car in front of you. The system will speed up or slow down in order to
      maintain this safe distance. In some cars the system can even bring the
      car to a stop and start moving again on its own. However, in most cars
      you will have to press the accelerator pedal in order to start moving
      again. This is still better than having to constantly switch between
      the gas and brake pedal while you're driving. The way adaptive cruise
      control works is that the car has sensors built in that track the cars
      around your vehicle.

  <h4>Automatic Emergency Braking</h4>
  <div class="Automatic-Emergency-Braking">
    <p>
Automatic Emergency Braking is a system where the car will apply the brakes for you if it feels that a crash is about to happen. This system is helpful because you can become distracted while driving very quickly. The system works very similarly to adaptive cruise control in that the car has sensors that keep track of the vehicle’s surroundings. The car’s computer is constantly evaluating your surroundings. If the car thinks you will get in a car it can avoid the crash completely or it will reduce your speed, so the effects of the crash aren’t as bad. So, if you’re shopping for a brand-new car this is a feature that you want. In some more advanced cars, the car will steer away from the accident if it is safe to do so.

  <h4>360-Degree Camera</h4>
  <div class="360-Degree-Camera">
    <p>
  The 360-degree camera is a very useful feature. Most accidents actually happen in parking lots. With the 360 degree camera it will help you when maneuvering around a parking lot. The camera can also be used in combination with parking sensors to help you know how close you are getting to the cars around you. Most modern cars come with a backup camera, but not all cars come with 360-degree cameras. The way the system works is that there are cameras positioned in different places on the car. The cars computer digitally stiches all of the images together in order to display what you see on the screen. The only down-side is that you can only use the camera at low speeds, so you can’t use it while you are on the highway.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h4>Lane Departure Warning</h4>
  <div class="Lane-Departure-Warning">
    <p>
    Lane departure warning is a system the notifies the driver whenever they start drifting outside of their lane. The system works by using sensors and cameras around the car. The car will beep or shake the steering wheel in order to get the driver’s attention. Some systems will keep the car centered in their lane which is helpful on the highway or long road trips. The one thing that you can call a downside to this system is that it may force the driver to keep their hands on the steering wheel. Which could be bad if you have children that you are trying to control. That feature is there to make sure that the driver still pays attention to the road since technology can malfunction. If you have a child driving it could help him or her stay in their lane.

  <h4>Stolen Vehicle Tracking Software</h4>
  <div class="Stolen-Vehicle">
    <p>
      Experts estimate that more than 750,000 motor vehicles will be stolen in 2019.
      While that number sounds alarming, nearly 46 percent of those vehicles will be
      recovered — and that number continues to improve. Much of the credit goes to
      innovative technology that automakers are building into their vehicles, such
      as the ability for the stolen car or truck to tell law enforcement when it
      is being held.
      The technology is bundled into the vehicle’s assistance and security systems,
      such as BMW’s Connected Drive or GM’s OnStar. While those advertised features
      allow effortless diagnostics, concierge, and post-crash notification for summoning
      rescue services, they may also be used by law enforcement to pinpoint the
      exact location of a vehicle that is no longer in the owner’s possession.
      Criminals beware.
