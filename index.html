  <h1>Milestones In Car Technology</h1>
  <hr>
  <h4>Adaptive Cruise Control</h4>
  <div class="daddy-shark">
    <p>
      Commuting is no fun. But advanced driver assist systems like adaptive cruise control can take a lot of the stress
      out of the experience. By using an array of sensors built into the car, adaptive cruise control can match the speed
      of the car in front of you, meaning you don't need to constantly hit the gas and brake in highway traffic.
      Some systems even allow the car to be brought to a complete halt and then resume automatically, making stop-and-go traffic
      considerably less frustrating. It might make you uneasy handing over some amount of control to the car, but we promise: use
      it once, and you'll never want to go back.

  <h4>Automatic Emergency Braking</h4>
  <div class="Automatic-Emergency-Braking">
    <p>
      Automatic Emergency Braking or AEB uses a variety of sensors to determine if a forward collision
      crash is imminent and automatically applies the brakes to diminish the severity or avoid a crash entirely.
      The auto industry agreed to make AEB standard in cars by 2022, but many vehicles have it available today.
      The systems are extremely good, though you absolutely shouldn't rely on it to stop you -- it's meant as a last
      resort for when the driver isn't paying attention, and it's extremely alarming when the system does engage.
      While Apple CarPlay and smartphone apps are important, this one could save your life, so it's worth making this one
      a high priority on your shopping list

  <h4>360-Degree Camera</h4>
  <div class="360-Degree-Camera">
    <p>
      Insurance claims from low-speed crashes are some of the most common in the
      industry. Usually occurring during parking, a 360-degree camera system can
      make life a lot easier for folks who might not realize just how big that new SUV is.
      By combining cameras on every side of the car with some clever computing power,
      your car's display can show a virtual top-down view of your surroundings.
      It can show the sides of your garage, whether you're lined up in the parking spot at the
      grocery store, or provide invaluable assistance while parallel parking.
      The systems are getting cheaper and cheaper, and are available on even moderately
      priced cars these days. If you're in the market for a small hatchback, you might
      not need this one as much -- but a big SUV? You could find it invaluable.

  <h4>Lane Departure Warning</h4>
  <div class="Lane-Departure-Warning">
    <p>
      Distracted driving happens. Whether it's a quick glance at the stereo to change
      the channel or a child urgently asking for your attention, sometimes we pay
      a little less attention to the road than we should.
      Lane departure warning systems use cameras to determine if a car has drifted
      across a marked lane line, giving a visual or audible notification
      (or even a vibration through the seat or steering wheel) that you've moved
      too far out of your lane. The system turns itself off when you use a directional,
      so there's no fear of accidental engagement.
      More advanced tech, sometimes called Lane Keeping Assist, can even help nudge
      you back into the proper lane, which can be a literal life-saver if you were heading
      into opposing traffic.

  <h4>Stolen Vehicle Tracking Software</h4>
  <div class="Stolen-Vehicle">
    <p>
      Experts estimate that more than 750,000 motor vehicles will be stolen in 2019.
      While that number sounds alarming, nearly 46 percent of those vehicles will be
      recovered — and that number continues to improve. Much of the credit goes to
      innovative technology that automakers are building into their vehicles, such
      as the ability for the stolen car or truck to tell law enforcement when it
      is being held.
      The technology is bundled into the vehicle’s assistance and security systems,
      such as BMW’s Connected Drive or GM’s OnStar. While those advertised features
      allow effortless diagnostics, concierge, and post-crash notification for summoning
      rescue services, they may also be used by law enforcement to pinpoint the
      exact location of a vehicle that is no longer in the owner’s possession.
      Criminals beware.
